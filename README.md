# Data Science Capstone Project - Shinyapp - Word Predictor
Final Data Science Capstone Project - Shinyapp for Word Predictor

This has been a very long and tedious project for me.  I'm a non-programmer.  I come from the program/project management side and continuous improvement, along with MS Access and SAP database experiences.  My interest in data science is to build a complete business model that integrates strategy planning, program management, project management, continuous improvement, analytics, business and MBSE modeling, and change management.  I have developed a business model that focuses on a Center for Innovation that consists of three divisions -- continuous improvement; analytics center of excellence; and modeling.  The objective of such an internal organization is to drive innovative business practices across the enterprise, thereby, achieving greater operating efficiencies and cost reduction while focusing on improving customer satisfaction, all of which should help to grow the value of the enterprise to it's customers.

This project started out at week 2.  
- data acquisiton
- data cleansing
- developing Ngrams to support more efficient processing
- and analysis of the data

The final project in week 7, is focused more on 
- further refining the Ngrams to improve processing for the Shinyapp.
- developing the predictor algorithms
- building and deploying the Shinyapp
- building the R presentation 

Throughout over 60 hours of working on this project, I have researched and tested many variations of algorithms to see what worked best.  It's been a lot of long and painful hours. I will have to say, I do not feel I was prepared by the training material to take on this type of project.   No examples to really follow to ensure you are at least following a standard process for this kind of coding.  

IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING ISSUES IN GETTING SHINYAPP TO WORK, READ THIS:  At first, I could not get my Shinyapp to work.  It kept "Disconnecting from the server".  After spending more time of working at it and researching how to resolve it, I found a posting where that stated you need to comment out setwd code.  Otherwise, it will not work within Shinyapp.
